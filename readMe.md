# Notes App with Svelte and TailwindCSS

A simple notes application built with Svelte and TailwindCSS that interacts with a mock API.

## Features
- View all notes
- Create new notes
- Edit existing notes
- Delete notes
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error handling

## Optional Features Implemented

- Confirmation modal for delete

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Build for Production

Run `npm run build`

## Trade-offs and Assumptions

- Used MockAPI.io as the backend service
- Implemented basic error handling
- Chose a simple, clean UI design
- Assumed notes would be relatively short in length

## Future Improvements

With more time, I would:

- Implement pagination or infinite scroll
- Add sorting functionality
- Improve the mobile experience further
- Add more comprehensive form validation
- Implement proper authentication
